# Android Weather App
Small weather application that uses open weather map:
[link to weather api](https://openweathermap.org/)

This is more of a code example than a proper app, as I personally struggled with parsing the JSON data, and so others might find it useful to have an example. Here is how the app should look. 

*If you build the app and it does not look like this, please ensure that you have  the correct version of gradle.The free weather api migth also cause some confustion, but if you are wondering why it does not update, its because the free api updates every 30min*
